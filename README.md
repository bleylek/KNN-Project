KNN Project

Introduction:
This project demonstrates the application of the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to a dataset, focusing on the entire machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation. The project showcases essential steps such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data standardization, model training/testing, and tuning the model by choosing an optimal K value.

Sections Covered
1. Import Libraries
The project begins by importing essential Python libraries required for handling data, performing EDA, and applying machine learning algorithms.

2. Get the Data
This section deals with loading the dataset (KNN_Project_Data) into the environment, preparing it for the analysis.

3. EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to understand the dataset better. This may include visualizations and statistics to uncover patterns, anomalies, or relationships within the data.

4. Standardize the Variables
Data standardization is crucial in KNN to neutralize the scale of the variables, ensuring that distance calculations are not biased by the scale of the features.

5. Train Test Split
The dataset is split into a training set and a testing set, enabling the evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data.

6. Using KNN
Implementation of the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify data points based on their similarity to the nearest K neighbors.

7. Predictions and Evaluations
This section focuses on making predictions with the trained KNN model and evaluating its performance using metrics such as the confusion matrix and classification report.

8. Choosing a K Value
The project explores the process of selecting an optimal K value that improves the model's accuracy, demonstrating the effect of varying K on model performance.

9. Retrain with new K Value
After choosing the best K value, the model is retrained to enhance its accuracy and then evaluated once again to confirm the improvements.
